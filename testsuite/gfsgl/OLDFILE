# Set "secondX" to true if you want games to start on it's own X server.
# Set it to "maybe" to start an X server if GFSGL is invoked from a tty
# without X running (this option has no effect on xgfsgl).
# NOTICE: secondX when invoked from X doesn't work on all systems
# due to security restrictions.
secondX="maybe"

# Set "ModuleBlacklist" to the modules you _never_ want GFSGL to load.
# This is useful if there s some basemodule that you don't want to load
# (basemodules are the modules that GFSGL loads even if they aren't in the
#  autoload directories).
# The basemodules for this release are: debug install cmd GameUpdate AutoAddGames.
# GFSGL will also try to load all modules starting with GMT_ automatically.
#
# NOTE: Modules added here can NOT be loaded AT ALL. If you want to load a
# module listed here without removing it's entry here then either rename
# the module file, or make a symlink to a new name.
ModuleBlacklist="install"
