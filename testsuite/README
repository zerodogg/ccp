CCP testsuite
-------------

The purpose of the testsuite is to make sure that CCP doesn't
break stuff that used to work. It is automated, just run
./ccp-testsuite and it will tell you if something breaks.

To get a list of the options that ccp-testsuite reacts to
run: ./ccp-testsuite --help

Adding tests
------------
It's actually quite simple. Create a directory, that will be the name
of the test, next put a NEWFILE (--newfile), OLDFILE (--oldfile) and
DESIRED_OUTPUT (the file CCP should create) and testsuite.conf

See the already existing tests for more info
