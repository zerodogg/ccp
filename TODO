TODO list for Common Configuration Parser.
Patches welcome, submit on https://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/?group=ccp

TODO for 0.3:
- - - - - - -
- Implement autodetection of options that has been uncommented by the user
  and automatic uncommenting of them in autogenerated templated.

TODO for 0.4
- - - - - - -
- Implement automatic addition of orphaned options to the end of the configuration
  file, as long as the config file isn't a ini-style file (no [-headers allowed]).
   (On the other hand, perhaps we should dump them all with any style.)
   In addition to this We should attempt to take the comments found above the
   setting in the old config and append them to the new, lastly we should add a
   comment (would require detection of which comments are used) above the settings
   that wasn't there but was appended. It should be possible to disable this
   via commandline options and via environment variables.
  This would require us to autodetecty php-style files and make sure that nothing gets
  appended after the ending PHP line.

Longer term TODO list:
- - - - - - - - - - - -
- Add support for supplying different --type(s)
	- So that ccp can upgrade different forms of config files
	- Read the list of supported types from a directory and do(); the file
	  matching the supplied type (?)
	- Adding support for ini-type should be easy, even without libconf
- Use libconf for additional configuration parsing
- Split out default type into a --type
- Add the ability to add options in the old file but not the template.
