TODO list for Common Configuration Parser.
Patches welcome, submit on https://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/?group=ccp

TODO for 0.4
- - - - - - -
- Add support for supplying different --type(s)
	- Split default one into default
	- If no --type supplied use default
- Add support for --renamedoption oldname=newname

TODO for 0.5
- - - - - - -
- Implement automatic addition of orphaned options to the end of the configuration
  file, as long as the config file isn't a ini-style file (no [-headers allowed]).
   (On the other hand, perhaps we should dump them all with any style.)
   In addition to this We should attempt to take the comments found above the
   setting in the old config and append them to the new, lastly we should add a
   comment (would require detection of which comments are used) above the settings
   that wasn't there but was appended. It should be possible to disable this
   via commandline options and via environment variables.
  This would require us to autodetecty php-style files and make sure that nothing gets
  appended after the ending PHP line.

Longer term TODO list:
- - - - - - - - - - -
- Use libconf for additional configuration parsing
