TODO list for Common Configuration Parser.
Patches welcome, submit on https://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/?group=ccp

- Add support for supplying different --type(s)
	- So that ccp can upgrade different forms of config files
	- Read the list of supported types from a directory and do(); the file
	  matching the supplied type (?)
	- Adding support for ini-type should be easy, even without libconf
- Use libconf for additional configuration parsing
- Split out default type into a --type
- Add --backup (copies --oldfile($OldFile) to $OldFile.ccpcopy (or similar)
	if --outputfile was not supplied)
